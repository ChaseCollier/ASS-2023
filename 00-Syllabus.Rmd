## Course description {-}

This course is for students who want to learn how to analyze, map, and model spatial and geographical data using the R programming language. It assumes students know some basic statistics through multiple linear regression. It also assumes students have some prior experience with using R. Students without knowledge of R should seek help through various online tutorials (see below).

In this course we survey the methods used to describe, analyze, and model _spatial_ data. Focus is on applications. Emphasis is given to how spatial statistical methods are related through the concept of spatial autocorrelation.

## Expected learning outcomes {-}

1. Learn how and when to apply statistical methods and models to spatial data, 
2. learn various packages in R for analyzing and modeling spatial data, and 
3. learn how to interpret the results of a spatial data model.

## Materials {-}

* Access to the internet and a computer.
* Lesson and assignment files on GitHub.
* There is no required textbook.
* Many excellent online resources are available. Here are some of my favorites.
  - R for Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
  - https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2020/a-very-short-introduction-to-tidyverse/
  - https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html

## Class meetings {-}

During each lesson I will work through and explain the R code within an `xx-Lesson.Rmd` file in the physical classroom. The notes in the lesson files are comprehensive, so you can work through them on your own if you can't make it to class. The notes are written using the markdown language. Markdown is a way to write content for the Web. An R markdown file has the suffix `.Rmd` (R markdown file). The file is opened using the RStudio application.

## Grades {-}

You are responsible for:

1. Reading and running the code in the lesson R markdown files (`.Rmd`) files. You can do this during the remote lessons as I talk and run my code or outside of class on your own.
2. Completing and returning the lab assignments on time.

Grades are determined only by how well you do on the assignments. based on the following standard:

* A: Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions
* B: Good: only minor errors/omissions
* C: Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission
* D: Poor: several major errors/omissions
* F: Fail: many major errors/omissions

I'll use the +/- grading system.

Grades will be posted as they are recorded on [FSU Canvas](https://canvas.fsu.edu)

## Ethics {-}

Academic honor code

https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy

Americans With Disabilities Act

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center; (2) bring a letter indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done during the first week of classes.

Diversity and inclusiveness

It is my intent to present notes and data that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.

## Reproducible research  {-}

A scientific paper has at least two goals: announce a new result and convince readers that the result is correct. Scientific papers should describe the results _and_ provide a clear protocol to allow repetition and extension.

Analysis and modeling tools should integrate text with code to make it easier to provide a clear protocol of what was done.

* Such tools make doing research efficient. Changes are made with little effort.
* Such tools allow others to build on what you've done. Research achieves more faster.
* Collaboration is easier.
* Code sharing leads to greater research impact. Research impact leads to promotion & tenure.

Free and open source software for geospatial data has progressed at an astonishing rate. High performance spatial libraries are now widely available. 

However, much of it is still not easy to script. Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like QGIS (see https://qgis.org) have greatly reduced the 'barrier to entry' but emphasis on the graphical user interface (GUI) makes reproducible research difficult. 

Instead here we focus on a command line interface (CLI) to enable reproducible work flows.
