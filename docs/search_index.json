Every question is a defect.” — Allen Holub Class notes You should now have a set of class notes as lesson files in your own GitHub repository and on your laptop. Note that these files are based on last semester’s class. I will update them as we proceed through the semester So at the start of each class (Sync from GitHub then Pull from RStudio) Go to https://github.com/[your GitHub username] Select the Sync fork button under the green Code button Click Update branch Open the Folder ASS-2023-[your name] on your Desktop Open the file ASS-2023.Rproj Under the Git tab select blue arrow (pointing down) to Pull down changes from your GitHub repository Select the XX-Lesson.Rmd file Note: If you see a yellow caution sign when you open the lesson file, download the required packages Don’t push! You can add notes to the lesson files (_.Rmd) on your computer You can add new files to your local directory These changes stay on your computer only Don’t push them to your GitHub repository! At the end of the semester you can push your notes to your repository Check the Staged button under the Git tab for all files you want to push Then select the Commit button Add a note to the Commit message section (e.g., my updates) Select the green arrow (pointing up) to Push changes to your GitHub The first time you do this you need to include your GitHub username and Personal access token Get a personal access token Go to your GitHub account In the far upper-right pull down menu (next to your avatar) select Settings then Developer settings In the left menu select Personal access tokens &gt; Tokens (classic) Follow instructions to generate a personal access toke (PAT) Use your PAT as your password when pushing changes made on your computer to your GitHub account Finally you can unfork your repository (see the instructions here https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/unfork-github-repo) Using R Consider a set of integers representing the number of hurricanes making landfall in the United States from the last ten years. You assign the values to an object and print the contents of the object by wrapping the line of code in parentheses ( d &lt;- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1) ) ## [1] 2 3 0 3 1 0 0 1 2 1 Suppose you are interested in the inter annual variability in the set of landfall counts. The variance is computed as \\[ \\hbox{var}(x) = \\frac{(x_1 - \\bar x)^2 + (x_2 - \\bar x)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - \\bar x)^2}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2 \\] Note: the markdown file recognizes math written in LaTeX. The formula for the variance is written using LaTeX notation gets rendered as a math equation (like you see in a textbook) See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions Although the var() function computes this, here you do this using simple functions. The key is to find the squared differences and then sum these values x &lt;- d xbar &lt;- mean(x) x - xbar ## [1] 0.7 1.7 -1.3 1.7 -0.3 -1.3 -1.3 -0.3 0.7 -0.3 (x - xbar)^2 ## [1] 0.49 2.89 1.69 2.89 0.09 1.69 1.69 0.09 0.49 0.09 sum((x - xbar)^2) ## [1] 12.1 n &lt;- length(x) n ## [1] 10 sum((x - xbar)^2)/(n - 1) ## [1] 1.344444 var(x) ## [1] 1.344444 Elements in a vector object must all have the same type. This type can be numeric, as in counts, character strings, as in simpsons &lt;- c(&#39;Homer&#39;, &#39;Marge&#39;, &#39;Bart&#39;, &#39;Lisa&#39;, &#39;Maggie&#39;) simpsons ## [1] &quot;Homer&quot; &quot;Marge&quot; &quot;Bart&quot; &quot;Lisa&quot; &quot;Maggie&quot; Character strings are made with matching quotes, either double, \", or single, '. If you mix types the values will be coerced into a common type, which is usually a character string. Arithmetic operations do not work on character strings Returning to the land falling hurricane counts. Suppose the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reanalyzes a storm, and that the 6th year of the decade is a 1 rather than a 0 for the number of landfalls. In this case you change the sixth element to have the value 1 d[6] &lt;- 1 You assign to the 6th year of the decade a value of one. The square brackets [] are used to reference elements of the data vector Key: Parentheses () are used by functions and square brackets [] are used by data objects d ## [1] 2 3 0 3 1 1 0 1 2 1 d[2] ## [1] 3 d[-4] ## [1] 2 3 0 1 1 0 1 2 1 d[c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)] ## [1] 2 0 1 0 2 The first line prints all the elements of the vector d. The second prints only the 2nd value of the vector. The third prints all but the 4th value. The fourth prints the values with odd element numbers To create structured data, for example the integers 1 through 99 you can use the : operator 1:99 rev(1:99) 99:1 The seq() function is more general. You specify the sequence interval with the by = or length = arguments seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 seq(from = 1, to = 9, length = 5) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 The rep() function is used to create repetitive sequences. The first argument is a value or vector that you want repeated and the second argument is the number of times you want it repeated rep(1, times = 10) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 rep(simpsons, times = 2) ## [1] &quot;Homer&quot; &quot;Marge&quot; &quot;Bart&quot; &quot;Lisa&quot; &quot;Maggie&quot; &quot;Homer&quot; &quot;Marge&quot; &quot;Bart&quot; ## [9] &quot;Lisa&quot; &quot;Maggie&quot; In the second example the vector simpsons containing the Simpson characters is repeated twice To repeat each element of the vector use the each = argument rep(simpsons, each = 2) ## [1] &quot;Homer&quot; &quot;Homer&quot; &quot;Marge&quot; &quot;Marge&quot; &quot;Bart&quot; &quot;Bart&quot; &quot;Lisa&quot; &quot;Lisa&quot; ## [9] &quot;Maggie&quot; &quot;Maggie&quot; More complicated patterns can be repeated by specifying pairs of equal length vectors. In this case, each element of the first vector is repeated the corresponding number of times given by the element in the second vector rep(c(&quot;long&quot;, &quot;short&quot;), times = c(2, 3)) ## [1] &quot;long&quot; &quot;long&quot; &quot;short&quot; &quot;short&quot; &quot;short&quot; To find the maximum number of landfalls during the first decade you type max(d) ## [1] 3 What years had the maximum? d == 3 ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Notice the double equals signs (==). This is a logical operator that tests each value in d to see if it is equal to 3. The 2nd and 4th values are equal to 3 so TRUEs are returned Think of this as asking R a question. Is the value equal to 3? R answers all at once with a vector of TRUE’s and FALSE’s What years had more than 2 hurricanes? d &gt; 2 ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Now the question is how do you get the vector element corresponding to the TRUE values? That is, which years have 3 landfalls? which(d == 3) ## [1] 2 4 The function which.max() can be used to get the first maximum which.max(d) ## [1] 2 You might be interested in the total number of landfalls in the decade or the number of years in a decade without a landfall sum(d) ## [1] 14 sum(d == 0) ## [1] 2 With a logical vector the TRUE elements are treated as having a value of 1 and the FALSE elements are treated as having a value of 0 The rm() function removes an object from your environment rm(d) Data frames Spatial data frames are used throughout this course. A spatial data frame is a data frame plus information on where the observations were taken A data frame stores data in a tabular format like a spreadsheet. It is a list of vectors each with the same length. It has column names (and sometimes row names) For example, you create a data frame object df containing three vectors n, s, b each with three elements using the data.frame() function n &lt;- c(2, 3, 5) s &lt;- c(&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;cc&quot;) b &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) df &lt;- data.frame(n, s, b) To see check on the type of object you use the class() function with the name of the object inside the parentheses class(df) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; The object df is of class data.frame. Note that the object name shows up in our Environment under Data and it includes a little blue arrow indicating that you can view it by clicking on the row The data frame shows up as a table (like a spreadsheet) in the View() mode (see the command in the console below). This is not advised for large data frames! The top line of the table is called the header. Each line below the header contains a row of data, which begins with the name (or number) of the row followed by the data values Each data element is in a cell. To retrieve a data value from a cell, you enter its row and column coordinates in that order in the single square bracket [] operator and separated by a column df[row, column] Here is the cell value from the first row, second column of df df[1, 2] ## [1] &quot;aa&quot; You print the column names (located in the top row in the View() mode) with the names() function names(df) ## [1] &quot;n&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;b&quot; The list of names is a vector of length three containing the elements n, s, and b in that order You access individual columns of a data frame as vectors by appending the dollar sign ($) to the object name. For example, to print the values of the column labeled s type df$s ## [1] &quot;aa&quot; &quot;bb&quot; &quot;cc&quot; Many packages include example data frames. The data frame called mtcars, for instance, contains information extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models) class(mtcars) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; names(mtcars) ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; ## [11] &quot;carb&quot; The number of data rows and data columns in the data frame are printed using the nrow() and ncol() functions nrow(mtcars) ## [1] 32 ncol(mtcars) ## [1] 11 Further details of built-in data frames like mtcars is available in the documentation accessed with the help() (or ?) function help(mtcars) If you type the name of the data frame in the console all the data are printed mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 Instead, you use the function head(), which prints the first six rows, or str(), which lists all the columns by data type head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 str(mtcars) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 11 variables: ## $ mpg : num 21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ... ## $ cyl : num 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ... ## $ disp: num 160 160 108 258 360 ... ## $ hp : num 110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ... ## $ drat: num 3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ... ## $ wt : num 2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ... ## $ qsec: num 16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ... ## $ vs : num 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ... ## $ am : num 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ gear: num 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ... ## $ carb: num 4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ... Consider the data frame studentdata from the {LearnBayes} package. To access this data frame, first install the package with the install.packages() function You put the name of the package {LearnBayes} in quotes (single or double). Then to make the functions from the package available to your current session use the library() function with the name of the package (unquoted) inside the parentheses if(!require(LearnBayes)) install.packages(pkgs = &quot;LearnBayes&quot;, repos = &quot;http://cran.us.r-project.org&quot;) ## Loading required package: LearnBayes library(LearnBayes) Note: The argument repos = in the install.packages() function directs where the package is obtained on CRAN (comprehensive R archive network). The CRAN repository is set automatically when using RStudio and you can install packages by clicking on Packages &gt; Install in the lower-right panel You need to specify the repository. When you render the markdown file (using the Knit button) you don’t want to install packages that already exist on your computer so you add the conditional if() function that says “only install the package IF it is not (!) available” Make a copy of the data frame by assigning it to an object with the name df and print the first six rows using the head() function df &lt;- studentdata head(df) ## Student Height Gender Shoes Number Dvds ToSleep WakeUp Haircut Job Drink ## 1 1 67 female 10 5 10 -2.5 5.5 60 30.0 water ## 2 2 64 female 20 7 5 1.5 8.0 0 20.0 pop ## 3 3 61 female 12 2 6 -1.5 7.5 48 0.0 milk ## 4 4 61 female 3 6 40 2.0 8.5 10 0.0 water ## 5 5 70 male 4 5 6 0.0 9.0 15 17.5 pop ## 6 6 63 female NA 3 5 1.0 8.5 25 0.0 water Data frames are like spreadsheets with rows and columns. Each row is an observation (here each row is a student in an intro stats class at Bowling Green State University) and each column is a variable. Here the variables are answers to questions like what is your height, choose a number between 1 and 10, what time did you go to bed last night, etc The names of the columns are printed using the names() function names(df) ## [1] &quot;Student&quot; &quot;Height&quot; &quot;Gender&quot; &quot;Shoes&quot; &quot;Number&quot; &quot;Dvds&quot; &quot;ToSleep&quot; ## [8] &quot;WakeUp&quot; &quot;Haircut&quot; &quot;Job&quot; &quot;Drink&quot; All columns are of the same length, but not all students answered all questions so some of the data frame cells contain the missing-value indicator NA (not available) Values in a data frame stored in rows and columns and are accessed with bracket notation [row, column] where row is the row number and column is the column number like a matrix For example here you specify the value in the 10th row and 2nd column (Height column) of the df data frame df[10, 2] ## [1] 65 By specifying only the row index and leaving the column index blank you get all values in that row, which corresponds to all the responses given by the 10th student df[10, ] ## Student Height Gender Shoes Number Dvds ToSleep WakeUp Haircut Job Drink ## 10 10 65 male 10 7 22 2.5 8.5 12 0 milk Drink preference was one of the questions.

For example, answers given to the question of student height result in a numeric variable, answers given to the question about drink preference result in a character (or factor) variable For integer, character, and factor variables you summarize the set of responses with the table() function table(df$Drink) ## ## milk pop water ## 113 178 355 There are 113 students who prefer milk, 178 prefer soda, and 355 prefer water Here you use theplot() method to make a draft plot of this table plot(x = df$Drink) Notice that the sum of the responses is 646, which is less than the total number of students (657). Students who left that question blank are ignored in the table() function. To include the missing values you add the argument useNA = \"ifany\" to the table() function. table(df$Drink, useNA = &quot;ifany&quot;) ## ## milk pop water &lt;NA&gt; ## 113 178 355 11 Note: When you want code executed directly within the text you separate the code using single back ticks. This is useful when you write reports that need periodic updates when new data becomes available. Instead if you hard code the values in the text then you need to search the document for these values during each update of the report Suppose you are interested in examining how long students reported sleeping during the night. This was not asked directly. You compute it from the ToSleep and WakeUp times columns. You assign the result of the difference to a column we call SleepHrs df$SleepHrs &lt;- df$WakeUp - df$ToSleep head(df) ## Student Height Gender Shoes Number Dvds ToSleep WakeUp Haircut Job Drink ## 1 1 67 female 10 5 10 -2.5 5.5 60 30.0 water ## 2 2 64 female 20 7 5 1.5 8.0 0 20.0 pop ## 3 3 61 female 12 2 6 -1.5 7.5 48 0.0 milk ## 4 4 61 female 3 6 40 2.0 8.5 10 0.0 water ## 5 5 70 male 4 5 6 0.0 9.0 15 17.5 pop ## 6 6 63 female NA 3 5 1.0 8.5 25 0.0 water ## SleepHrs ## 1 8.0 ## 2 6.5 ## 3 9.0 ## 4 6.5 ## 5 9.0 ## 6 7.5 Now you have a new numeric variable in the data frame called SleepHrs You can’t table numeric variables, but the summary() method prints a set of summary statistics for the set of values summary(df$SleepHrs) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s ## 2.500 6.500 7.500 7.385 8.500 12.500 4 The average number of hours slept is 7.4 with a maximum of 12.5 and a minimum of 2.5. There are four students that did not answer either when they went to sleep or when they woke up questions You use the hist() function to plot a histogram of sleep hours. The function takes as input a vector of values hist(df$SleepHrs) The function divides the number of sleep hours into one-hour bins and counts the number of students whose reported sleep hours falls into each bin. For example based on when they said they went to sleep and when the said they woke up, about 100 students slept between five and six hours the night before the survey Is the amount of sleep for a student related to when they go to bed? If you place numeric variables on the x and y axes then you get a scatter plot plot(x = df$ToSleep, y = df$SleepHrs) The ToSleep variable is centered on midnight so that -2 means a student went to sleep at 10p You describe the decreasing relationship with a line through the points. The least-squares line is fit using the lm() function and the line is drawn on the existing plot with the abline() function applied to the linear regression object model. model &lt;- lm(SleepHrs ~ ToSleep, data = df) plot(x = df$ToSleep, y = df$SleepHrs) abline(model) Getting data into R You often start a research project by getting data into R. The file is on your computer or in the cloud. Secondary source data should be imported directly from repositories on the Web. When there is no direct link or API (application programming interface) to the repository, you need to first download the data For example, consider the annually updated reports of tornadoes in the United States. The data repository is the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/index.html#data Here you are interested in the file 1950-2021_actual_tornadoes.csv. First download the file from the site with the download.file() function specifying the location (url =) and a name you want the file to be called on your computer (destfile =) download.file(url = &quot;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2021_actual_tornadoes.csv&quot;, destfile = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Tornadoes.csv&quot;)) A file called Tornadoes.csv is now be located in the directory data. Click on the Files tab in the lower-right panel, then select the data folder Next you read (import) the file as a data frame using the readr::read_csv() function from the {tidyverse} group of packages. Torn.df &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Tornadoes.csv&quot;)) ## Rows: 67558 Columns: 29 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (4): mo, dy, st, stf ## dbl (23): om, yr, tz, stn, mag, inj, fat, loss, closs, slat, slon, elat, el... ## date (1): date ## time (1): time ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Observations for each report include variables like the day and time, the state (st), the maximum EF rating (mag), the number of injuries (inj), the number of fatalities (fat), estimated property losses (loss), estimated crop losses (closs), start and end locations in decimal degrees longitude and latitude, length of the damage path in miles (len), width of the damage in yards (wid) The total number of tornado reports in the data set is returned using the nrow() function nrow(Torn.df) ## [1] 67558 To create a subset of the data frame that contains only tornadoes in years (yr) since 2001, you include the logical operator yr &gt;= 2001 inside the subset operator ([]). The logical operator is placed in front of the comma since you want all rows where the result of the operator returns a value TRUE. After the column is left blank since you want all the variables Torn2.df &lt;- Torn.df[Torn.df$yr &gt;= 2001, ] You see that there are fewer rows (tornado reports) in this new data frame assigned the object name Torn2.df. You subset again, keeping only tornadoes with EF ratings (mag variable) greater than zero. Here you recycle the name Torn2.df Torn2.df &lt;- Torn2.df[Torn2.df$mag &gt; 0, ] Now you compute the correlation between EF rating (mag) and path length (len) with the cor() function. The first argument is the vector of EF ratings and the second argument is the vector of path lengths cor(Torn2.df$mag, Torn2.df$len) ## [1] 0.4868764 Path length is recorded in miles and path width in yards and the EF damage rating variable mag is numeric. Here you convert path length to kilometers, path width to meters, and the EF rating to a factor and include these changes as new columns in the data frame. Torn2.df$Length &lt;- Torn2.df$len * 1609.34 Torn2.df$Width &lt;- Torn2.df$wid * .9144 Torn2.df$EF &lt;- factor(Torn2.df$mag) Create side-by-side box plots of path length (in kilometers) by EF rating. plot(x = Torn2.df$EF, y = Torn2.df$Length/1000) Another example: Annual U.S. hurricane counts Here you import the data directly from the Web by specifying the URL as a character string using the file = argument loc &lt;- &quot;http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/US.txt&quot; USHur.df &lt;- readr::read_table(file = loc) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## Year = col_double(), ## All = col_double(), ## MUS = col_double(), ## G = col_double(), ## FL = col_double(), ## E = col_double() ## ) The dim() function returns the size of the data frame defined as the number of rows and the number of columns dim(USHur.df) ## [1] 166 6 There are 166 rows and 6 columns in the data frame. Each row is a year and the columns include Year, number of hurricanes (All), number of major hurricanes (MUS), number of Gulf coast hurricanes (G), number of Florida hurricanes (FL), and number of East coast hurricanes (E) in that order To get a glimpse of the data values you list the first six lines of the data frame using the head() function head(USHur.df) ## # A tibble: 6 × 6 ## Year All MUS G FL E ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1851 1 1 0 1 0 ## 2 1852 3 1 1 2 0 ## 3 1853 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 1854 2 1 1 0 1 ## 5 1855 1 1 1 0 0 ## 6 1856 2 1 1 1 0 The distribution of Florida hurricane counts by year is obtained using the table() function and specifying the FL column with df$FL table(USHur.df$FL) ## ## 0 1 2 3 4 ## 93 43 24 5 1 There are 93 years without a FL hurricane, 43 years with exactly one hurricane, 24 years with two hurricanes, and so on Another example: Statewide average rainfall in Florida. Work through it on your own The data are monthly statewide average rainfall (in inches) for Florida starting in 1895. The data were obtained from http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/ I put values into a text editor and then uploaded the file to http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLprecip.txt You get the data into R with the readr::read_table() function.

The functions work only on data frames Function names are English language verbs so they are easier to remember. The verbs help you translate thought into code Here we consider some of verbs using the airquality data frame. The data frame contains air quality measurements taken in New York City between May and September 1973 (?airquality) at time when pollution levels in the city were at an all time high dim(airquality) ## [1] 153 6 head(airquality) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 The columns include Ozone (ozone concentration in ppb), Solar.R (solar radiation in langleys), Wind (wind speed in mph), Temp (air temperature in degrees F), Month, and Day. You get summary statistics on the values in each column with the summary() method. summary(airquality) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp ## Min. : 1.00 Min. : 7.0 Min. : 1.700 Min. :56.00 ## 1st Qu.: 18.00 1st Qu.:115.8 1st Qu.: 7.400 1st Qu.:72.00 ## Median : 31.50 Median :205.0 Median : 9.700 Median :79.00 ## Mean : 42.13 Mean :185.9 Mean : 9.958 Mean :77.88 ## 3rd Qu.: 63.25 3rd Qu.:258.8 3rd Qu.:11.500 3rd Qu.:85.00 ## Max. :168.00 Max. :334.0 Max. :20.700 Max. :97.00 ## NA&#39;s :37 NA&#39;s :7 ## Month Day ## Min. :5.000 Min. : 1.0 ## 1st Qu.:6.000 1st Qu.: 8.0 ## Median :7.000 Median :16.0 ## Mean :6.993 Mean :15.8 ## 3rd Qu.:8.000 3rd Qu.:23.0 ## Max. :9.000 Max. :31.0 ## Note that columns that have missing values are tabulated. For example, there are 37 missing ozone measurements and 7 missing radiation measurements Importantly for making your code more human readable you can apply the summary() function on the airquality data frame using the pipe operator (|&gt;) airquality |&gt; summary() ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp ## Min. : 1.00 Min. : 7.0 Min. : 1.700 Min. :56.00 ## 1st Qu.: 18.00 1st Qu.:115.8 1st Qu.: 7.400 1st Qu.:72.00 ## Median : 31.50 Median :205.0 Median : 9.700 Median :79.00 ## Mean : 42.13 Mean :185.9 Mean : 9.958 Mean :77.88 ## 3rd Qu.: 63.25 3rd Qu.:258.8 3rd Qu.:11.500 3rd Qu.:85.00 ## Max. :168.00 Max. :334.0 Max. :20.700 Max. :97.00 ## NA&#39;s :37 NA&#39;s :7 ## Month Day ## Min. :5.000 Min. : 1.0 ## 1st Qu.:6.000 1st Qu.: 8.0 ## Median :7.000 Median :16.0 ## Mean :6.993 Mean :15.8 ## 3rd Qu.:8.000 3rd Qu.:23.0 ## Max. :9.000 Max. :31.0 ## You read the pipe as THEN. “take the airquality data frame THEN summarize the columns” The pipe operator allows you to string together functions that when read by a human makes it easy to understand what is being done Think of it this way: suppose the object of interest is called me and there is a function called wake_up(). I could apply this function called wake_up() in two ways wake_up(me) # way number one, classical way me |&gt; wake_up() # way number two, tidyverse way The second way involves more typing but it is easier to read (the subject comes before the predicate like simple English grammar) and thus easier to understand. This becomes clear when stringing together functions Continuing with the made-up example, what happens to the result of me after the function wake_up() has been applied? I get_out_of_bed() and then get_dressed() Again, you can apply these functions in two ways get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))) me |&gt; wake_up() |&gt; get_out_of_bed() |&gt; get_dressed() The order of the functions usually matters to the outcome. I can’t get dressed before I wake up but I could get dressed without getting out of bed Note how I format the code. Each line is gets only one verb and each line ends with the pipe (except the last one). This makes it easier to read Continuing… me |&gt; wake_up() |&gt; get_out_of_bed() |&gt; get_dressed() |&gt; make_coffee() |&gt; drink_coffee() |&gt; leave_house() Which is much better in terms of ‘readability’ then leave_house(drink_coffee(make_coffee(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me)))))). Tibbles are data frames that make working with data frames a little easier. R is an old language, and some things that were useful 10 or 20 years ago now get in your way. To make a data frame a tibble (tabular data frame) use the as_tibble() function class(airquality) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; airquality &lt;- dplyr::as_tibble(airquality) class(airquality) ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Click on airquality in the environment. It is a data frame. We will use the terms ‘tibble’ and ‘data frame’ interchangeably in this class Now you are ready to look at some of the commonly used verbs and to see how to apply them to a data frame The function select() chooses variables by name. For example, choose the month (Month), day (Day), and temperature (Temp) columns. airquality |&gt; dplyr::select(Month, Day, Temp) ## # A tibble: 153 × 3 ## Month Day Temp ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 5 1 67 ## 2 5 2 72 ## 3 5 3 74 ## 4 5 4 62 ## 5 5 5 56 ## 6 5 6 66 ## 7 5 7 65 ## 8 5 8 59 ## 9 5 9 61 ## 10 5 10 69 ## # … with 143 more rows The result is a data frame containing only the three columns with column names listed in the select() function. Suppose you want a new data frame with only the temperature and ozone concentrations.

For example, to compute the average wind speed during July or the average temperature during June type airquality |&gt; dplyr::filter(Month == 7) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(Wavg = mean(Wind)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## Wavg ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 8.94 airquality |&gt; dplyr::filter(Month == 6) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(Tavg = mean(Temp)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## Tavg ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 79.1 You’ve seen functions that compute statistics including sum(), sd(), min(), max(), var(), range(), median(). Others include Summary function Description dplyr::n() Length of the column dplyr::first() First value of the column dplyr::last() Last value of the column dplyr::n_distinct() Number of distinct values Find the maximum and median wind speed and maximum ozone concentration values during the month of May. Also determine the number of observations during May airquality |&gt; dplyr::filter(Month == 5) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(Wmax = max(Wind), Wmed = median(Wind), OzoneMax = max(Ozone), NumDays = dplyr::n()) ## # A tibble: 1 × 4 ## Wmax Wmed OzoneMax NumDays ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 20.1 11.5 NA 31 The result gives an NA for the maximum value of ozone (OzoneMax) because there is at least one missing value in the Ozone column. You fix this with the na.rm = TRUE argument in the function max() airquality |&gt; dplyr::filter(Month == 5) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(Wmax = max(Wind), Wmed = median(Wind), OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), NumDays = dplyr::n()) ## # A tibble: 1 × 4 ## Wmax Wmed OzoneMax NumDays ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 20.1 11.5 115 31 If you want to summarize separately for each month you use the group_by() function. You split the data frame by some variable (e.g., Month), apply a function to the individual data frames, and then combine the output Find the highest ozone concentration by month. Include the number of observations (days) in the month airquality |&gt; dplyr::group_by(Month) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), NumDays = dplyr::n()) ## # A tibble: 5 × 3 ## Month OzoneMax NumDays ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 5 115 31 ## 2 6 71 30 ## 3 7 135 31 ## 4 8 168 31 ## 5 9 96 30 Find the average ozone concentration when temperatures are above and below 70 F. Include the number of observations (days) in the two groups airquality |&gt; dplyr::group_by(Temp &gt;= 70) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(OzoneAvg = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), NumDays = dplyr::n()) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## `Temp &gt;= 70` OzoneAvg NumDays ## &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 FALSE 18.0 32 ## 2 TRUE 49.1 121 On average ozone concentration is higher on warm days (Temp &gt;= 70 F) days. Said another way; mean ozone concentration statistically depends on temperature The mean is a model for the data. The statistical dependency of the mean implies that a model for ozone concentration will be improved by including temperature as an explanatory variable In summary, the important verbs are Verb Description select() selects columns; pick variables by their names filter() filters rows; pick observations by their values arrange() re-orders the rows mutate() creates new columns; create new variables with functions of existing variables summarize() summarizes values; collapse many values down to a single summary group_by() allows operations to be grouped The six functions form the basis of a grammar for data. You can only alter a data frame by reordering the rows (arrange()), picking observations and variables of interest (filter() and select()), adding new variables that are functions of existing variables (mutate()), collapsing many values to a summary (summarise()), and conditioning on variables (group_by()) The syntax of the functions are all the same The first argument is a data frame. This argument is implicit when using the |&gt; operator The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You refer to columns in the data frame directly (without using $) The result is a new data frame These properties make it easy to chain together many simple lines of code to do complex data manipulations and summaries all while making it easy to read by humans "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
