Elsner Instructor Location: Bellamy Building, Room 314 Lesson Hours: TR 8:00-9:15 a.m. Student Hours: TR 9:15-9:45 a.m., MW 2:15-3 p.m. Email: jelsner@fsu.edu Links to my professional stuff Website GitHub Mastodon Course description and expected learning outcomes This course is for students who want to learn how to analyze, map, and model spatial and geographical data using the R programming language. It assumes you know basic statistics through multiple linear regression. And that you have some prior experience with using R. If you have no knowledge of R you should look at various online tutorials (see below) All course materials are available on GitHub https://github.com/jelsner/ASS-2023 In this course you will get a survey of the methods used to describe, analyze, and model spatial data. Focus will be on applications. Emphasis is on how statistical methods are related through the concept of spatial autocorrelation Expected learning outcomes Learn how and when to apply statistical methods and models to spatial data, learn various packages for analyzing and modeling spatial data, and learn how to interpret the results of a spatial data model The course offers a programming approach to exposing you to spatial statistics. I want to demystify the process and give you confidence that you can analyze and fit spatial models. I believe some investment in honing programming skills and in learning how to work collaboratively will pay dividends for you later on But in taking this approach I don’t want to give you the false impression that statisticians have the answers. A working knowledge of the model fitting process needs to be combined with a good understanding of the domain-specific context in which you are working Materials and class meetings {-} Access to the internet and a computer All course materials are available through GitHub https://github.com/jelsner/ASS-2023 No textbook is required Many excellent online resources are also available. Here are some of my favorites Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ Tidyverse https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2020/a-very-short-introduction-to-tidyverse/ Statistics https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html Census data https://walker-data.com/census-r/wrangling-census-data-with-tidyverse-tools.html Class meetings During each lesson I will work through and explain the R code and notes contained within an xx-Lesson.Rmd file. Lessons will be held in this classroom (BEL 320). The notes in the lesson files are comprehensive, so you can work through them on your own if you are unable to make it to class The notes are written using the markdown language. Markdown is a way to write content for the Web. An R markdown file has the suffix .Rmd (R markdown file). The file is opened using the RStudio application Grades and ethics You are responsible for: Reading and running the code in the lesson R markdown files (.Rmd) files. You can do this during the lessons as I talk and run my code or outside of class on your own Completing and returning the lab assignments on time Grades are determined by how well you do on the assignments using the following standard: A: Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions B: Good: only minor errors/omissions C: Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission D: Poor: several major errors/omissions F: Fail: many major errors/omissions I’ll use the +/- grading system Grades will be posted as they are recorded on FSU Canvas Academic honor code https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy Americans With Disabilities Act Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center; (2) bring a letter indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done during the first week of classes Diversity and inclusiveness It is my intent to present notes and data that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture Outline of topics and schedule Date Lesson/Lab January 10 Syllabus January 12 Lesson 1 January 17 Lesson 2 January 19 Lesson 3 January 24 Lesson 4 January 26 Lab 1 January 31 Lesson 5 February 2 Lesson 6 February 7 Lesson 7 February 9 Lesson 8 February 14 Lab 2 February 16 Lesson 9 February 21 Lesson 10 February 23 Lesson 11 February 28 Lesson 12 March 2 Lab 3 March 7 Lesson 13 March 9 FREE March 14 Spring Break March 16 Spring Break March 21 Lesson 14 March 23 Lesson 15 March 28 Lesson 16 March 30 Lesson 17 April 4 Lesson 18 April 6 Lesson 19 April 11 Lab 4 April 13 Lesson 20 April 18 Lesson 21 April 20 Lesson 22 April 25 Lab 5 April 27 FREE Working with data and making graphs (4 lessons) Working with spatial data and making maps (4 lessons) Quantifying spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression (4 lessons) Analyzing and modeling point pattern data (7 lessons) Estimating variograms and interpolating spatially (3 lessons) 27 dates: 22 lesson days + 5 lab days Lab Date Lessons covered 1 Thursday January 26 1-4 2 Tuesday February 14 5-8 3 Tuesday March 2 9-12 4 Tuesday April 11 13-19 5 Tuesday April 25 20-22 Reference materials Bivand, R.

An introduction to the ggplot package for graphics Recent research examples More hots Stronger tornadoes Reproducible research A scientific paper has at least two goals: announce a new result and convince readers that the result is correct. Scientific papers should describe the results and provide a clear protocol to allow repetition and extension Analysis and modeling tools should integrate text with code to make it easier to provide a clear protocol of what was done Such tools make doing research efficient. Changes are made with little effort Such tools allow others to build on what you’ve done. Research achieves more faster Collaboration is easier Code sharing leads to greater research impact. Research impact leads to promotion &amp; tenure Free and open source software for geospatial data has progressed at an astonishing rate. High performance spatial libraries are now widely available However, much of it is still not easy to script. Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like QGIS (see https://qgis.org) have greatly reduced the ‘barrier to entry’ but emphasis on the graphical user interface (GUI) makes reproducible research difficult Instead here we will focus on a command line interface (CLI) to help you create reproducible work flows You might be interested in this article: Practical reproducibility in geography and geosciences Getting you set up Do this 1st Download and install {{&lt; fa brands r-project &gt;}} by going to https://cloud.r-project.org/ If you are using {{&lt; fa brands windows &gt;}}: Click on Download R for Windows, then click on base, then click on the Download link If you are using a {{&lt; fa brands apple &gt;}}: Click on Download R for (Mac) OS X, then under Latest release: click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.
