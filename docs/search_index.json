These objects have discrete, well-defined borders and a high level of precision. Precision does not imply accurate. The raster model for data (raster data) represents continuous fields (like elevation and rainfall) using a grid of cells (raster). A raster aggregates fields to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scale-able. The smallest features within the field are blurred or lost. The choice data model depends on the application: Vector data dominates the social sciences because human settlements and boundaries have discrete borders. Raster data (e.g., remotely sensed imagery) dominates the environmental sciences because environmental conditions are typically continuous. Geographers, ecologists, demographers use vector and raster data. Here we will use functions from the {sf} package to work with vector data and functions in the {terra} and {raster} packages to work with raster data sets. We will also look at functions from the new {stars} package that work with both vector and raster data models. R’s spatial ecosystem continues to evolve. Most changes build on previous work. Occasionally there is a significant change that builds from scratch. The introduction of the {sf} package in about 2018 is a significant change. sf for simple features Simple features is a standard from the Open (‘open source’) Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to represent geographic information. It condenses geographic forms into a single geometry class. The standard is used in spatial databases (e.g., PostGIS), commercial GIS (e.g., ESRI) and forms the vector data basis for libraries such as GDAL. A subset of simple features forms the GeoJSON standard. The {sf} package supports these classes and includes plotting and other methods. Functions in the {sf} package work with all common vector geometry types: points, lines, polygons and their respective ‘multi’ versions (which group together features of the same type into a single feature). The functions also work with geometry collections, which contain multiple geometry types in a single object. The raster data classes are not supported. The {sf} package incorporates the three main packages of the spatial R ecosystem: {sp} for the class system, {rgdal} for reading and writing data, and {rgeos} for spatial operations done with GEOS. Simple features are data frames with a column for storing the spatial information. The spatial column is called geometry (or geom). The geometry column is referenced like a regular column but it has special features. The geometry column is a ‘list column’ of class sfc (simple feature column). And the sfc is a set of objects of class sfg (simple feature geometries). Simple Feature Anatomy green box is a simple feature: a single record (observation), or data.frame row, consisting of attributes and geometry blue box is a single simple feature geometry (an object of class sfg) red box a simple feature column as a list (an object of class sfc, which is a column in the data.frame) the geometries are given in well-known text (WKT) format Geometries are the building blocks of simple features. Well-known text (WKT) is the way simple feature geometries are coded. Well-known binaries (WKB) are hexadecimal strings readable by computers. GIS and spatial databases use WKB to transfer and store geometry objects. WKT is a human-readable text description of simple features. The two formats are exchangeable. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry In WKT format a point is a coordinate in 2D, 3D or 4D space (see vignette(\"sf1\") for more information) such as: POINT (5 2) The first number is the x coordinate and the second number is the y coordinate. A line string is a sequence of points with a straight line connecting the points, for example: LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2) Each pair of x and y coordinates is separated by a comma. A polygon is a sequence of points that form a closed, non-intersecting ring. Closed means that the first and the last point of a polygon have the same coordinates. A polygon has one exterior boundary (outer ring) but it can have interior boundaries (inner rings). An inner ring is called a ‘hole’. Polygon without a hole - POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) Here there are two parentheses to start and two to end the string of coordinates. Polygon with one hole - POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4)) Here the first set of coordinates defines the outer edge of the polygon and the next set of coordinates defines the hole. The outer edge vertexes are connected in a counterclockwise direction. The inner edge vertexes (defining the hole in the polygon) are connected in a clockwise direction. Simple features allow multiple geometries (hence the term ‘geometry collection’) using ‘multi’ version of each geometry type: Multi-point - MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2) Multi-string - MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4)) Multi-polygon - MULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2))) The difference between a multi-point and multi-string is an extra set of parentheses. The difference between a polygon with a hole and a multi-polygon is that the vertexes of each polygon are connected in a counterclockwise direction. A collection of these is made: Geometry collection - GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))) Simple feature geometry (sfg) The sfg class represents the simple feature geometry types: point, line string, polygon (and their ‘multi’ equivalents, such as multi points) or geometry collection. Usually you don’t need to create geometries. Geometries are part of the spatial data you import. However, there are a set of functions to create simple feature geometry objects (sfg) from scratch, if needed. The names of these functions are simple and consistent, as they all start with the st_ prefix and end with the name of the geometry type in lowercase letters: A point - st_point() A linestring - st_linestring() A polygon - st_polygon() A multipoint - st_multipoint() A multilinestring - st_multilinestring() A multipolygon - st_multipolygon() A geometry collection - st_geometrycollection() An sfg object can be created from three data types: A numeric vector - a single point A matrix - a set of points, where each row contains a point - a multi-point or line string A list - any other set, e.g. a multi-line string or geometry collection To create point objects, you use the st_point() function from the {sf} package applied to a numeric vector. sf::st_point(c(5, 2)) # XY point ## POINT (5 2) sf::st_point(c(5, 2, 3)) # XYZ point ## POINT Z (5 2 3) To create multi-point objects, you use matrices here constructed from the rbind() function. mp.matrix &lt;- rbind(c(5, 2), c(1, 3), c(3, 4), c(3, 2)) mp.matrix ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 5 2 ## [2,] 1 3 ## [3,] 3 4 ## [4,] 3 2 sf::st_multipoint(mp.matrix) ## MULTIPOINT ((5 2), (1 3), (3 4), (3 2)) ls.matrix &lt;- rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)) sf::st_linestring(ls.matrix) ## LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2) sf::st_linestring(ls.matrix) ## LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2) plot(sf::st_multipoint(mp.matrix)) plot(sf::st_linestring(ls.matrix)) To create a polygon, you use lists. poly.list &lt;- list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))) sf::st_polygon(poly.list) ## POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) poly.border &lt;- rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)) poly.hole &lt;- rbind(c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4)) poly.with.hole.list &lt;- list(poly.border, poly.hole) sf::st_polygon(poly.with.hole.list) ## POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4)) plot(sf::st_polygon(poly.list)) plot(sf::st_polygon(poly.with.hole.list)) Simple feature geometry column One sfg object contains a single simple feature geometry. A simple feature geometry column (sfc) is a list of sfg objects together with information about the coordinate reference system. For example, to combine two simple features into one object with two features, you use the st_sfc() function. This is important since sfg represents the geometry column in sf data frames. point1 &lt;- sf::st_point(c(5, 2)) point2 &lt;- sf::st_point(c(1, 3)) sf::st_sfc(point1, point2) ## Geometry set for 2 features ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 ## CRS: NA ## POINT (5 2) ## POINT (1 3) In most cases, a sfc object contains objects of the same geometry type. Thus, when you convert sfg objects of type polygon into a simple feature geometry column, you end up with an sfc object of type polygon. A geometry column of multiple line strings would result in an sfc object of type multilinestring. An example with polygons. poly.list1 &lt;- list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))) polygon1 &lt;- sf::st_polygon(poly.list1) poly.list2 &lt;- list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2))) polygon2 &lt;- sf::st_polygon(poly.list2) sf::st_sfc(polygon1, polygon2) ## Geometry set for 2 features ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 0 ymin: 1 xmax: 4 ymax: 5 ## CRS: NA ## POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) ## POLYGON ((0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)) plot(sf::st_sfc(polygon1, polygon2)) An example with line strings. mls.list1 &lt;- list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)), rbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4))) mls1 &lt;- sf::st_multilinestring((mls.list1)) mls.list2 &lt;- list(rbind(c(2, 9), c(7, 9), c(5, 6), c(4, 7), c(2, 7)), rbind(c(1, 7), c(3, 8))) mls2 &lt;- sf::st_multilinestring((mls.list2)) sf::st_sfc(mls1, mls2) ## Geometry set for 2 features ## Geometry type: MULTILINESTRING ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 1 ymin: 1 xmax: 7 ymax: 9 ## CRS: NA ## MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 ... ## MULTILINESTRING ((2 9, 7 9, 5 6, 4 7, 2 7), (1 ... plot(sf::st_sfc(mls1, mls2)) An example with a geometry collection. sf::st_sfc(point1, mls1) ## Geometry set for 2 features ## Geometry type: GEOMETRY ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 1 ymin: 1 xmax: 5 ymax: 5 ## CRS: NA ## POINT (5 2) ## MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 ... A sfc object also stores information on the coordinate reference systems (CRS). To specify a certain CRS, you use the epsg or proj4string attributes. The default value of epsg and proj4string is NA (Not Available). sf::st_sfc(point1, point2) ## Geometry set for 2 features ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 ## CRS: NA ## POINT (5 2) ## POINT (1 3) All geometries in an sfc object must have the same CRS.

The coordinate system is related to Earth by the WGS84 geodetic datum. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_coordinate_reference_systems Simple feature data frames Features (geometries) typically come with attributes. The attributes might represent the name of the geometry, measured values, groups to which the geometry belongs, etc. The simple feature class, sf, is a combination of an attribute table (data.frame) and a simple feature geometry column (sfc). Simple feature objects are created using the st_sf() function. Objects of class sf behave like regular data frames. methods(class = &quot;sf&quot;) ## [1] [ [[&lt;- $&lt;- aggregate as.data.frame ## [6] cbind coerce filter identify initialize ## [11] merge plot print rbind show ## [16] slotsFromS3 transform ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code Simple features have two classes, sf and data.frame. This is central to the concept of simple features: most of the time a sf can be treated as, and behaves like, a data.frame. Simple features are, in essence, data frames but with a column containing the geometric information (sfc) I refer to simple feature objects as ‘simple feature data frames’ to distinguish them from S4 class spatial data frames. Many of these functions were developed for data frames including rbind() (for binding rows of data together) and $ (for creating new columns). The key feature of sf objects is that they store spatial and non-spatial data in the same way, as columns in a data.frame. The geometry column of {sf} objects is typically called geometry but any name can be used. Thus sf objects take advantage of R’s data analysis capabilities to be used on geographic data. It’s worth reviewing how to discover basic properties of vector data objects. For example, you get information about the size and breadth of the world simple feature data frame from the {spData} package using dim(), nrow(), etc. library(spData) dim(world) ## [1] 177 11 nrow(world) ## [1] 177 ncol(world) ## [1] 11 The data contains ten non-geographic columns (and one geometry column) with 177 rows each one representing a country. Extracting the attribute data from an sf object is the same as dropping its geometry. world.df &lt;- world |&gt; sf::st_drop_geometry() class(world.df) ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Example: Temperatures at FSU and at the airport Suppose you measure a temperature of 25C at FSU and 22C at the airport at 9a on September 6, 2022. Thus, you have specific points in space (the coordinates), the name of the locations (FSU, Airport), temperature values and the date of the measurement. Other attributes might include a urbanity category (campus or city), or a remark if the measurement was made with an automatic station. Start by creating to sfg (simple feature geometry) point objects. FSU.point &lt;- sf::st_point(c(-84.29849, 30.44188)) TLH.point &lt;- sf::st_point(c(-84.34505, 30.39541)) Then combine the point objects into a sfc (simple feature column) object. our.geometry &lt;- sf::st_sfc(FSU.point, TLH.point, crs = 4326) Then create a data frame of attributes. our.attributes &lt;- data.frame(name = c(&quot;FSU&quot;, &quot;Airport&quot;), temperature = c(10, 5), date = c(as.Date(&quot;2021-01-27&quot;), as.Date(&quot;2021-01-27&quot;)), category = c(&quot;campus&quot;, &quot;airport&quot;), automatic = c(TRUE, FALSE)) Finally create a simple feature data frame. sfdf &lt;- sf::st_sf(our.attributes, geometry = our.geometry) The example illustrates the components of sf objects. First, you use coordinates to define the geometry of the simple feature geometry (sfg). Second, you can combine the geometries into a simple feature geometry column (sfc) which also stores the CRS. Third, you store the attribute information on the geometries in a data.frame. Fourth, you use the st_sf() function to combine the attribute table and the sfc object into a sf object. sfdf ## Simple feature collection with 2 features and 5 fields ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -84.34505 ymin: 30.39541 xmax: -84.29849 ymax: 30.44188 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 ## name temperature date category automatic geometry ## 1 FSU 10 2021-01-27 campus TRUE POINT (-84.29849 30.44188) ## 2 Airport 5 2021-01-27 airport FALSE POINT (-84.34505 30.39541) class(sfdf) ## [1] &quot;sf&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Given a simple feature data frame you create a non-spatial data frame with a geometry list-column but that is not of class sf using the as.data.frame() function. sf &lt;- sfdf |&gt; as.data.frame() class(df) ## [1] &quot;function&quot; In this case the geometry column is no longer a sfc. no longer has a plot method, and lacks all dedicated methods listed above for class sf In order to avoid any confusion it might be better to use the st_drop_geometry() column instead. df &lt;- sfdf |&gt; sf::st_drop_geometry() Example: US states The object us_states from the {spData} package is a simple feature data frame from the U.S. Census Bureau. The variables include the name, region, area, and population. Simple feature data frames can be treated as regular data frames. But the geometry is “sticky”. For example when we create a new data frame containing only the population information the geometry column is included in the new data frame. df1 &lt;- us_states |&gt; dplyr::select(starts_with(&quot;total&quot;)) head(df1) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -114.8136 ymin: 24.55868 xmax: -71.78699 ymax: 42.04964 ## Geodetic CRS: NAD83 ## total_pop_10 total_pop_15 geometry ## 1 4712651 4830620 MULTIPOLYGON (((-88.20006 3... ## 2 6246816 6641928 MULTIPOLYGON (((-114.7196 3... ## 3 4887061 5278906 MULTIPOLYGON (((-109.0501 4... ## 4 3545837 3593222 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.48731 4... ## 5 18511620 19645772 MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.81169 2... ## 6 9468815 10006693 MULTIPOLYGON (((-85.60516 3...

Why use the {sf} package when {sp} is already tried and tested? Fast reading and writing of data Enhanced plotting performance sf objects are treated as data frames in most operations sf functions are combined using |&gt; operator and they work well with the {tidyverse} packages sf function names are consistent and intuitive (all begin with st_) These advantages led to the development of spatial packages (including {tmap}, {mapview} and {tidycensus}) that now support simple feature objects. It is easy to convert between the two classes. Consider the world S3 spatial data frame from the {spData} package. You convert it to a S4 spatial data frame with the as() method. world.sp &lt;- world |&gt; as(Class = &quot;Spatial&quot;) The method coerces simple features to Spatial* and Spatial*DataFrame objects. You convert a S4 spatial data frame into a simple feature data frame with the st_as_sf() function. world.sf &lt;- world.sp |&gt; sf::st_as_sf() You can create basic maps from simple feature data frames with the base plot() method (plot.sf()). The function creates a multi-panel one sub-plot for each variable. Geo-computation on simple features Geo-computation on simple features is done with routines in the geometry engine-open source (GEOS) library that the functions in the {sf} package make use of. As an example, consider the file police.zip on my website that contains shapefiles in a folder called police. The variables include police expenditures (POLICE), crime (CRIME), income (INC), unemployment (UNEMP) and other socio-economic variables for counties in Mississippi. Input the data using the st_read() function from the {sf} package and then assign a geographic coordinate reference system (CRS) to it using the EPSG number 4326. download.file(url = &quot;http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/police.zip&quot;, destfile = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;police.zip&quot;)) unzip(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;police.zip&quot;), exdir = here::here(&quot;data&quot;)) sfdf &lt;- sf::st_read(dsn = here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;police&quot;), layer = &quot;police&quot;) ## Reading layer `police&#39; from data source ## `/Users/jameselsner/Desktop/ClassNotes/ASS-2022/data/police&#39; ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 82 features and 21 fields ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -91.64356 ymin: 30.19474 xmax: -88.09043 ymax: 35.00496 ## CRS: NA sf::st_crs(sfdf) &lt;- 4326 The geometries are polygons and there are 82 of them, one for each county.

Since there are 82 counties and one centroid the matrix has 82 rows and 1 column. All matrix entries are FALSE except the one containing the center. To map the result you first plot the county polygons with the geom_sf() function (layer), then add the county geometry for the center county and fill it red. You use the matrix that you called Contains to subset this county. Finally you add the location of the state centroid to the plot. library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = sfdf) + geom_sf() + geom_sf(data = sfdf[Contains, ], col = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_sf(data = stateCenter.sfc) + theme_void() The function st_area() returns a vector of the geographical area (in sq. units) of each of the spatial objects.
